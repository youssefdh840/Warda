  Generate a unique, engaging, and high-quality ${type} card for a social game.
  The intensity level is: ${intensity}. 
  The difficulty level is: ${difficulty}. (EASY means safe, simple, and lighthearted. HARD means more challenging, deeper, riskier, or more complex).
  The selected player is: ${selectedPlayer.name}. 
  The other players are: ${otherPlayers}.
  CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: All output text (both "title" and "description") MUST be written strictly in ${targetLanguage}.
  
  Guidelines:
  - Truth: Thought-provoking, social, emotional or funny questions.
  - Dare: Safe, interactive, physical or verbal challenges (no internet/camera needed).
  - Secret: A hidden mission for ${selectedPlayer.name} that only they should see.
  - Chaos: A game-breaking rule change or group-wide activity.
  
  Adhere strictly to both intensity and difficulty. ${difficulty} difficulty ${type} should feel noticeably ${difficulty === Difficulty.HARD ? 'more intense/tricky' : 'more chill/casual'} than EASY.`;
